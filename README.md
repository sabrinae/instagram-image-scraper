This script was heavily influenced by <a href="https://ctrlq.org/code/20538-instagram-scraping">this article by Amit Agarwal</a> and <a href="http://www.googleappsscript.org/home/downloading-instagram-photos-to-your-google-drive-using-google-apps-script">this somewhat outdated script</a>. I cannot take credit for this, it is simply a combination of my findings from other developers.
